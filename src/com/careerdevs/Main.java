public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	// write your code here
        /* Function is a block of code that performs a task
         ReturnType Name() {
         ...
         }
         void is a returnType in java
         parenthesis  is used to pass the parameters
         before the code block
         every java must have an entry point and it is called main()
         when java is function is called the code in the main is being executed
         this main() does not exist on its own it belongs to a class
          defining a Class ==> a container for related functions used to organize codes.
          an access modifier is a special keyword that determines if other methods
          and functions can access this classes and methods. i.e public or private

          public class Main {
            public void main () {
            ...
            }
          }

    In java there different naming conventions that are used i.e
    PascalNamingConvention for classes
    camelNamingConvention for methods

    compilation and execution happens whenever code is run in intellij
    ls is used to know where you at in the terminal
    java runtime environment convert byte code into native
    code via java virtual machine
    cd is used to change to the preferred file we want to be
